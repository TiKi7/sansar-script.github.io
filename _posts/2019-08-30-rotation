So you want to move stuff. To begin with there are two types of objects in Sansar, physical objects and non physical objects. 

## Physical objects

Physical objects are are objects that have collision, in the properties editor or object structure, this will appear as a "volume" and the object itself will have a "motion type" property, along with "density" and "friction".

### Motion Type Property

The "motion type" property is extremely important when it comes to physics objects and it greatly affects how the object behaves and what can be done to the object from the script API.

The "static" motion type indicates that the object will not ever be moving. This is considered the most restrictive motion type. In fact static objects built into the scene are assumed never to move and are potentially optimized by the build process, so script manipulation of static objects is not possible.

The "keyframed" motion type indicates that the object will only move when explicitly moved from script. This is the next most restrictive motion type. When keyframed objects are moved, they will not stop or otherwise be affected by any other collisions. They will simply move through everything and push avatars and dynamic objects out of the way.

The "dynamic" motion type indicates that the object will be subject to gravity and other phsyical interactions. This is the least restrictive motion type. Dynamic objects will fall, roll and slide depending on what forces get applied to them in the scene. They will collide with static and keyframed objects and avatars.

Motion types can be changed from script but only to a more restrictive motion type than the initial import or scene settings allow. So for example, an object imported as "dynamic" can be set to "keyframed" from script but an object imported as "static" can not be set to "keyframed" or "dynamic".

## Non physical objects

Non physical objects have no collision
