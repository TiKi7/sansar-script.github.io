So you want to move stuff. Lets define what stuff can be moved, there are two types of objects in Sansar that can be scripted to move, physical objects and non physical objects. 

## Physical objects

Physical objects are are objects that have collision, you will know if they have collision by looking at the object `Properties`, you will see a section for `Volume` as well as setting for `Motion Type`, `Friction` and `Bounce`

### Motion Type Property

The `motion type` property is extremely important when it comes to physics objects and it greatly affects how the object behaves and what can be done to the object from the script API.

The `Static` motion type indicates that the object will never be moving. This is considered the most restrictive motion type. In fact static objects built into the scene are assumed never to move and are potentially optimized by the build process, so script manipulation of static objects is not possible.

The `Keyframed` motion type indicates that the object will only move when explicitly moved from script. This is the next most restrictive motion type. When keyframed objects are moved, they will not stop or otherwise be affected by any other collisions. They will simply move through everything and push avatars and dynamic objects out of the way.

The `Dynamic` motion type indicates that the object will be subject to gravity and other phsyical interactions. This is the least restrictive motion type. Dynamic objects will fall, roll and slide depending on what forces get applied to them in the scene. They will collide with static and keyframed objects and avatars.

Motion types can be changed from script but only to a more restrictive motion type than the initial import or scene settings allow. So for example, an object imported as `Dynamic` can be set to `Keyframed` from script but an object imported as `Static` cannot be set to `Keyframed` or `Dynamic`.

## Non physical objects

Objects that have no collision are considered non-physical objects in Sansar. These can be moved with the Mover API if they are configured to be allowed to move. Much like `Static objects above, objects that are not configured for movement are assumed never to move and are potentially optimized by the build process.

To configure an object for movement, set the `Movable From Script` and the `IsScriptable` attributes set to `On`.

## Mover API

The [`Mover API`](https://lindenlab.github.io/sansar-script.github.io/assets/Documentation/Sansar.Simulation/Mover.html) can drive non-physical objects as well as physical objects that have their `Motion Type` set to `Keyframed` as well as  `Movable From Script` toggle `On`.

Properly configured objects can then be immediately moved using any of these functions, where `position` is a [`Sansar.Vector`](https://lindenlab.github.io/sansar-script.github.io/assets/Documentation/Sansar/Vector.html) and `rotation` is a [`Sansar.Quaternion`](https://lindenlab.github.io/sansar-script.github.io/assets/Documentation/Sansar/Quaternion.html).


    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddMove(position, rotation);
    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddTranslate(position);
    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddRotate(rotation);

You may also use these interfaces to control the movement over time using additional parameters specifying length of time in seconds and [`MoveMode`](https://lindenlab.github.io/sansar-script.github.io/assets/Documentation/Sansar.Simulation/MoveMode.html), `EaseIn`, `EaseOut`, `Linear` and `SmoothStep`.

    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddMove(position, rotation, seconds, moveMode);
    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddTranslate(position, seconds, moveMode);
    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddRotate(rotation, seconds, moveMode);

Mover functions act like a queue and execute commands sequentially. In this way it is possible to make a simple behavior to move an object through a set of points as shown in the [Patrol Mover](https://github.com/lindenlab/sansar-script/blob/961122c8aac22206d615455be56e3d8430c19d58/Samples/PatrolMoverScript.cs) sample script.

    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddTranslate(point1, 5.0, MoveMode.Linear);
    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddTranslate(point2, 5.0, MoveMode.Linear);
    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddTranslate(point3, 5.0, MoveMode.Linear);
    ObjectPrivate.Mover.AddTranslate(point4, 5.0, MoveMode.Linear);

Utility functions like `WaitFor`, [`AddPause`](https://lindenlab.github.io/sansar-script.github.io/assets/Documentation/Sansar.Simulation/Mover.html#M:Sansar.Simulation.Mover.AddPause(System.Double)) and [`StopAndClear`](https://lindenlab.github.io/sansar-script.github.io/assets/Documentation/Sansar.Simulation/Mover.html#M:Sansar.Simulation.Mover.StopAndClear()) can be used to control movement commands executions for finer control over movement. 


## Vectors

[`Sansar.Vector`](https://lindenlab.github.io/sansar-script.github.io/assets/Documentation/Sansar/Vector.html) struct represents a three dimensional vector using the standard [Cartesian coordinate system](https://mathinsight.org/vectors_cartesian_coordinates_2d_3d#vector3D) of `X`,`Y`,`Z`. The Vector class provides three interfaces for supplying coordinate values but the most common is in the signature of `Vector (float X, float Y, float Z, float W)`. The `W` coordinate. W defaults to 0 and is assumed to be 0 for most operations if it is not specified.

![3D Vector]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/movement/cartesian-coordinates.png)

Lets look at the [Patrol Mover](https://github.com/lindenlab/sansar-script/blob/961122c8aac22206d615455be56e3d8430c19d58/Samples/PatrolMoverScript.cs) sample script to see an example of how we can use vectors in our scripts to move an object along the vector axis'.

Start by creating a new scene and choosing the `Base Template Scene`. 

![Base Template Scene]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/movement/base-template-scene.png)

Notice the scene is blank with nothing but a spawn point. In the Settings for the spawn point set the position `X = 0`, `Y = -0.5`, `Z = 0` this will place the tip of the spawn point, making it look like an arrow pointing, at the coordinates `0,0,0`. From above it should look like a piece of graph paper where the grid lines indicate each square area of the `X` and `Y` axis'.

![Base Template Spawn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/movement/base-spawn.png)

Next drag an object to animate into the scene, I am using a free [Wrasse Fish](https://store.sansar.com/listings/9e3ea0eb-bc71-44ae-8b3e-a5e7e382065f/wrasse-fish) non physical object in this example as it has a distinct head and tail which will be important in the next section when we discuss rotation. 

For now drag your object in front of the spawn point and set it coordinates at `Position` `X = 1`, `Y = 1`, `Z = 0` so that you are to the front right of the scene center. You'll also want to turn on the `Movable from Script` and `IsScriptable` toggles.

![Base Template Spawn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/movement/fish-initial.png)

Import the [Patrol Mover](https://github.com/lindenlab/sansar-script/blob/961122c8aac22206d615455be56e3d8430c19d58/Samples/PatrolMoverScript.cs) sample script and attach it to the fish. It will provide four inputs to create an area to patrol. Lets keep it simple and input the coordinates for four points of a single cell square.

![Base Template Spawn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/movement/patrol-settings.png)

Build and visit the scene to see the fish is indeed moving around the square, but fish don't move like that, so we're going to have add some rotations so that the fish swims in the direction its head is facing, like _irl_.

## Quaternions

[`Sansar.Quaternion`](https://lindenlab.github.io/sansar-script.github.io/assets/Documentation/Sansar/Quaternion.html) struct represents a quaternion orientation. Quaternions are not a light subject and I would be nothing but honest by saying this tutorial cannot provide an explanation of what a quaternion is in earnest. The goal for this lesson is to make familiar the usage of this class and it's methods in Sansar scripting, however there are some wonderfully in depth materials I will happily share in the [resources](#resources) section of this post for anyone that is wanting that extra depth of information and understanding. I would also welcome any pull requests that can add in addendum to this post at any point in time.

Picking up on the Patrol we'd like to add rotations


### Resources

This wonderfully made series of interactive video lessons called [Visualizing Quaternions](https://eater.net/quaternions) is a must for the intensely curious.
